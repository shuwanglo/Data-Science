    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The COVID-19 pandemic needs no introduction. Beyond the millions of deaths worldwide, the pandemic has had far-reaching secondary effects. The pandemic is now considered not only a health crisis, but also a social and economic crisis. The repercussions of which, have yet to be fully explored and understood. \n",
    "\n",
    "In early 2020 until mid 2021 most parts of the United States were subject to shelter-in-place orders by local government. The result of which on physical health has not been widely studied quantitatively but the cultural and societal shift has been obvious. \n",
    "\n",
    "The pandemic has caused disruptions in daily routines, including changes in work, school, and exercise patterns. Many people have been working from home and spending more time indoors, leading to more sedentary behavior and less physical activity. Additionally, the pandemic has caused an increase in stress and anxiety levels, which can lead to overeating and unhealthy food choices.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to a study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) in March 2021 (Source: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db360.htm), the prevalence of obesity in the United States increased from 42.4% in 2017-2018 to 44.9% in 2019-2020. The study suggests that the COVID-19 pandemic may have contributed to this increase in obesity rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, the pandemic has disproportionately affected certain populations, including those with lower incomes, who are more likely to have limited access to healthy foods and safe places to exercise. These disparities can exacerbate existing health inequities related to obesity. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on obesity rates in the United States, highlighting the importance of maintaining healthy habits, even during times of stress and uncertainty.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to learn about how the COVID-19 pandemic and its associated lockdowns and cultural/social shifts have affected the physical health of average Americans. From the data we gather ourselves, as well as data provided by the *Centers for Disease Control and Prevention* (CDC) we will attempt to learn more about how Americans have a whole have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and which groups of Americans have been most affected.

    "\n",
    "We have chosen to use data provided by a United States federal agency called the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The CDC has gained prominence in the US since the beginning of the pandemic for its extensive work in testing and halting the spread of the coronavirus epidemic. However, the agency is more traditionally associated with surveying public health. Consequently the agency records an abundance of public health statistics that can be used to paint a picture of the average American’s health before, during, and after the pandemic. \n",
    "\n",
    "As with almost all government collected public data, the CDC data is made available on its website (https://chronicdata.cdc.gov) public use. For the purposes of this survey we will be combining several data sets that survey public health that cover a variety of topics. These include such areas as obesity rates, average physical exercise, nutritional gain, as well as public policy information. \n",
    "\n",
    "The CDC has in the past been involved with some controversies regarding its handling of the initial stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, along with some very public clashes with then-president Trump. However, these controversies have never been associated with the quality and validity of its data. The CDC exists fundamentally as an apolitical entity and its collected data can be reasonably assumed to be free of bias and to be of good quality. \n",
